geluid - music player server with a web-based user interface

Now I'am testing Spring Security configuration with Hibernate

For building you have to install and configure JDK (now I build with Oracle JDK 8 on Vista and can't support anything else, but it *may* be built on different systems) and run Gradle (if you have one installed you know what to do), or run provided wrapper


```shell
gradlew clean assemble
```
and then run .jar in <Geluid>\build\libs

or directly launch application
```shell
gradlew clean bootRun
```
